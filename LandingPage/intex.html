        <p>Gardening and Care:
            Cultivating lilacs requires attention to specific growing conditions. They thrive in well-drained soil with ample sunlight and good air circulation. Pruning is essential to maintain their shape and encourage blooming, typically done just after flowering to ensure the growth of next year's buds. Adequate watering, especially during dry periods, is crucial for healthy growth. While generally hardy, lilacs can be susceptible to pests and diseases, necessitating occasional monitoring and care.</p>
